# Advanced-House-Price-Predictions
This is my first project and also participated in kaggle competition 

## Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project aims to forecast house prices using advanced regression techniques. This project is based on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques," leveraging detailed property data to build robust predictive models.

## Key Features
* Predict house prices using machine learning algorithms.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into the data.
* Feature engineering and selection to improve model performance.
* Model evaluation using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used
* Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Details
* Source: Kaggle's "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.
* Description: The dataset includes 80 features related to property characteristics, such as dwelling type, zoning, lot area, utilities, and sale conditions.
* Objective: Predict the sale price of houses based on their attributes.
  
## Results
Achieved a competitive score/rank of 3848 out of 6261 teams in the competition.
Visualization and performance metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented models.
